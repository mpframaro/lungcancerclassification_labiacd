# Lung Cancer Classification

This project was done for a third year curricular unit (Laboratórios de Inteligència Artificial e Ciência de Dados).

Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, along with PyLIDC and PyRadiomics, I developed 3 different models that, through the information extracted from the Computarized Tomography (CT) Scans in the dataset, are capable of classifying lung nodules as malign or non-malign.

The notebooks are divided in steps, which are numbered accordingly.
